## 🎯 What is Mayil Vision?

**Mayil Vision** is a professional-grade multi-sensor satellite intelligence framework designed for the automated monitoring of critical energy infrastructure. Derived from the Tamil word for "Peacock" (மயில்), the platform acts as an all-seeing guardian, utilizing the full electromagnetic spectrum to ensure grid resilience.

The framework orchestrates a fleet of specialized analysis engines that fuse optical, thermal, and radar data to identify risks - from encroaching vegetation to invisible methane leaks - before they escalate into costly failures.

> 💡 **Philosophy**: Just as the peacock's tail is adorned with a thousand eyes, Mayil Vision provides a thousand perspectives on infrastructure health through high-revisit satellite constellations.
